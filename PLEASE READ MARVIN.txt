
Hey Marvin,

* I was able to "grab" without ghosting. 
-> If you do play the code, you'll see one left behind, that is just another object of the class. 
   So its not the same cable.

*I have programmed Eject and Insert.
-> I did this through flags. Both should work accordingly.
-> NOTE: Please adjust RMRC movement for "inserting" the cable as it overshoots. 
  ALSO, Please adjust the cable to that is facing the port
	accordingly. 

-> Collision works with Rectangular Prism Class.
-> Retreat works but is yet to be integrated. It only needs to be mentioned in movement.m at every movement. Retreat Movement is already sorted. 
-> NOTE: I have not included yet your sensor input code.


HOW I SET UP THE CODE:
1.) You may find classes of 'environment' and 'cable'. This is so the script is shorter. 
2.) FOR movement.m 
-> There are flags there to set up a certain configuration or movement. For GUI what you could do is, when a 
press bottomn is pressed. It is trigger a flag. However, the movement.m will still run even there is not bottomn pressed.
It will just go to the diffult setup. 

WHATS there to do, besides GUI
1.) RETREAT and ESTOP/SENSOR INPUT still needs to be integrated. A condition still needs to be set that if any
collision/Estop/sensor input happens then SAWYER will RETREAT and break out of the movement.m file. 

OTHER FILES NOT INCLUDED IN THE UPLOAD GITHUB ARE:
* The ply files.
* rvctools.
ALSO: I HAVENT ADJUSTED THE COORD OF THE "NEW" ENVIRONMENT.

BESIDES ALL THESE, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN MY CODE WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD THE FILES.
